- [ ]  HTML
- [ ]  CSS
- [ ]  Jigsaw
- [ ]  Site deployed on Github pages with no errors

### How AI influenced workflow, focusing on efficiency and outcomes without in-depth prompt documentation:
I used Github desktop copilot to automatically generate cleaner and more concise commit messages.

### Challenges:
The darkmode toggle was causing an artefact when switching between pages. This was hard to debug but eventually I realised it was caused by the order of operations. The artefact was due to a "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC). To fix this issue I created a script that cached the user theme across the site and accessed it before the HTML elements were rendered. This way the darkmode was applied before any elements were rendered.
