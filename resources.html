                  Creatine is a popular supplement known for its benefits in
                  enhancing physical performance, particularly in high-intensity
                  exercise. However, emerging research suggests that creatine
                  may also have cognitive benefits, including improved memory
                  and mental fatigue resistance. Some studies indicate that
                  creatine supplementation could help
                  <strong> improve cognitive function </strong>
                  in individuals with ADHD by enhancing brain energy metabolism.
                  While more research is needed to confirm these effects, taking
                  creatine as part of a balanced diet may offer potential
                  benefits for managing ADHD symptoms. Always consult with a
                  healthcare professional before starting any new supplement.

                  Regular physical exercise can
                  <strong> significantly help individuals with ADHD</strong>
                  manage ADHD symptoms. Exercise increases the production of
                  neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, which play
                  key roles in attention and focus. Engaging in activities such
                  as aerobic exercise, strength training, or even yoga can
                  improve mood, reduce anxiety, and enhance cognitive function.
                  Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of
                  the week. Incorporating physical activity into your daily
                  routine can lead to better symptom management and overall
                  well-being.

                  Alcohol can significantly worsen ADHD symptoms by disrupting
                  sleep quality, <strong>reducing executive function</strong>,
                  and interfering with medication effectiveness. It can impair
                  focus, memory, and impulse control—areas already challenging
                  for those with ADHD. Additionally, alcohol affects dopamine
                  levels in the brain, which can exacerbate attention and
                  motivation issues. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation
                  and be mindful of how it affects your symptoms and overall
                  functioning.

                  Eating close to bedtime can disrupt sleep quality by keeping
                  your digestive system active when your body should be winding
                  down. Poor sleep
                  <strong>significantly impacts ADHD symptoms</strong>, making
                  focus and emotional regulation even more difficult. Try to
                  finish your last meal at least 4 hours before bed to give your
                  body time to digest. If you need a snack, opt for something
                  light and avoid sugary or caffeinated foods. Better sleep
                  hygiene leads to better symptom management during the day.

                  The blue light emitted by phones, tablets, and computers

                  The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be
                  <strong>particularly effective for ADHD.</strong> Work in
                  focused 25-minute intervals (called "Pomodoros") followed by
                  5-minute breaks. After completing four Pomodoros, take a
                  longer 15-30 minute break. This technique helps maintain focus
                  by breaking work into manageable chunks and provides regular
                  rewards (breaks) to keep motivation high. The structured
                  approach reduces overwhelm and makes it easier to start tasks,
                  while the timer creates a sense of urgency that can help
                  combat procrastination.

                  Light therapy using a 10,000 lux light box can help regulate

                  <strong>which are often disrupted in people with ADHD</strong

                  alertness, improve mood, and help with focus throughout the
                  day. Use the light box for 20-30 minutes each morning, ideally
                  within the first hour of waking. Position it at eye level
                  about 16-24 inches away. This can be especially helpful during
                  darker winter months or if you struggle with morning alertness

                  is an Android app designed to help manage tasks and reminders
                  through persistent notifications. For people with ADHD, out of
                  sight truly means out of mind. This app keeps important tasks
                  visible on your notification bar until you complete them,
                  acting as a constant but gentle reminder. You can set up
                  custom notifications for medication reminders, task deadlines,
                  habit tracking, or any other important activities.
                  <strong>
